    title: "Plastic",
    information:
      "Every single piece of plastic that has ever been produced still exists today. It isn't in the same place anymore, and probably unrecognizable - but it's certainly still there, just no longer visible to most of us.  "

    information:
      "The value of unused clothing in wardrobes has been estimated at around £30 billion. It is also estimated £140 million worth of clothing goes into landfill each year."

    title: "Food",
    information:
      "Each year 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of fish and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat."

    title: "Electric",
    information:
      "Electrical items contain a range of materials that can be separated for recycling and used in new products, such as plastics and precious metals including gold and copper. All this saves resources and energy. If electrical items end up in landfill, hazardous substances will leak out and cause soil and water contamination – harming wildlife and even human health."

  {
    title: "Glass",
    information:
      "Glass is the one item that can be recycled over and over again. It never looses quality like other products do. Today at least 25% of the glass that is used in items you buy has been recycled. The goal is to significantly increase it. In fact, there is absolutely no reason at all for glass to go to the landfills."
